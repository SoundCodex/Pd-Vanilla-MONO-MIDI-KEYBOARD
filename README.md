# Pd-Vanilla-MONO-MIDI-KEYBOARD

This is an abstraction made for live performance, patch testing, and quick demos. 
You can switch from MIDI mode to FREQUENCY mode using the gray toggle. Ã¹
Notes can be transposed two octaves above and below middle C (full 5-octave range).

Each key is a canvas placed on top of three bangs. This walkaround used to recreate the piano keyboard is very delicate. 
If you open the abstraction and click on a key (when in Edit-Mode), Pd will select the bang object underneath and not the canvas. 
Arranging each key is a very time demanding process so if you ever want to do that make shure to save a backup patch.
